# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It is the displine of designing, development, and maintaining software systems using principles to ensure the reliability, efficiency, and quality of the software
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engeneering stresses on the importance of a stractured process to ensure to esure the creation of high-quality maintainable software systems while traditional programming focuses on writting code to solve a specific problem whithout as much emphasis on systematic planning or scalability.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1 Planning:This is the phase that involves gathering requirements and understanding the objective of the project.
2 Requimet Analysisi:Detailed requiments for the softwaregathered ad documeted.
3 Design:In this phase, the software's architecture is created that is desiging system iterfaces, defining data structure and selecting algorithims.
4 Implementation (coding):Actual code is  written based on the design documents by converting the design into a software using suitable programmig languages.
5 Testing:The developed software is rigorously tested to identify and fix buds and ensure it meets the spesific requirements.
6 Development:This phase involves installing, cofiguring, and making the software operational to the target environment.
7 Maintenance:After deployment, the software is maintained to fix any issues that arise, and make updates, and improved performance.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development.
gile have an interactive and incremental approach while waterfall have a linear and sequential approach to software development.
What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
 Differences:
  Agile have an interractive and incremental approach while waterfall have a linear and sequential approach to software development.
Scenarios to be preffered:
  Agile is prefferd for projects requiring flexibility,frequent update and stakeholders involvement while waterfall is suitable for projects with well-defined, and fixed scope and a need for thorough documentation.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering?
Requirements engineering is a systematic process of defining, documenting and maintaining the requirements of  fos a software system.
 Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
 1 Requiment Elication: Gthering requirements for stackholders through interviews, surveys and workshops.
 2 Requiment Analysis: Analysing and refinig the gatherd requiments to slove ambiguities and conflicts.
 3 Requiment Specification:Documenting the requirements in a clear and comprehensive manner.
 4 Requirement Validation: Ensuring that the documented requirements meets the stakeholders' needs.
 5 Requirement Management: Managing changes to requirements throughout the projects lifecycle.
 IMPORTANCE:
 1 Clarity and understaning
 2 Scope definition
 3 Risk regulation
 4 Qualty assuarance.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design.
It is a design principle that involves dividing a software system into destinct, independent componets. 
 How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
 1 Isolation of Changes
2 Encapsulation
3 Reusability
4 Clear structure
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).
 1 unit Testing:To validate that individual units of the software works as intened.
 2 Integration Testing: To verify that different units or components of the system work together correctly.
 3 System Testing: To validate the completed and the integrated software system againist the specified requirements.
 4 Accepting Testing: To validate that the system meets the business requiments and is ready for deployment.
 Why is testing crucial in software development?
Helps in identifying bugs, errors, ensuring that the final product functions as inteded.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development?
 They are tools that help manage changes to source code and other project files over time, it is important because it helps in collaboration where by miltilpe developers can work on the same basecode sumultiniously without interfering with each others work.
 Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
1 Git
 2 Subversion
 3 Mercurial
 4 Perforce
 5 Concurrent Version Sytem
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager.
 1 Project planning:Clearly define the scope of the project.
2 Project execution: Ensures that software meets  the required quality standards
3 Project monitoring and Control: Track product expenses and ensures that the project stays within the allocated budget.
 What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
 1 Planning Schedules: Creating detailed projects plans, timeline and milestones to ensure project stays on track.
 2 Resource Management:Allocating and managing resources, including team members, budget and tools.
 3 Risk Management: Identifying assessing and mitigating risks that could impact the projects' sucess.
 4 Communication: Ensuring clear and effective communication among team members, stakeholders or clients.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities.Software maintainance is the process of modifying and updating software applications after their initial delivery to correct faults andimrove performance.
 DIFERENCES:
1 Condition-Based Maintanance:Monitor the actual condition of th equipment to decide what maintanance needs to be done.
2 Proactive Maintanance: Focuses on the identifying and addressing the root causes of equipment failures aiming to improve overall reliability and performance.
3 Emergency Maintainace: Unplanned and urgent maintenance needed to address immediate failures.
 Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
  It ensures that software remains functional, efficient, secure and alligned with the usres' needs and business goals throughout its lifespan.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face?
 1 Data collection and use: Ensuring that personal data is collected, stored, and use responsibilities promptly to project users.
 2 Securities Vulnerabilities: Addressing and fixing security vulnerabilities promptly to to protect users.
 3 Social ipmact: Considering the broader social impact of software and striving to contribute positively to the society.
 How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
 1 Staying Informed:Being up to  date whith ethical standards, legal requirements and best practices in software engineering.
 2 Clear Documentation: Maintain clear and honest documentation of software development processes and decisions.
